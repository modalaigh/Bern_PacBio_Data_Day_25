# Bern_PacBio_Data_Day_25
This repo contains scripts that were used to generate the single-cell coverage plots for the 10x and the Kinnex data. Please see `sc_gene_coverage` for an example of generating a single-cell gene coverage plot for 10x data and `ds_sc_gene_coverage` for an example of a plot comparing 10x and PacBio Kinnex gene coverage for the same group of cells.
